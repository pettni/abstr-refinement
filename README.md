# ABSTR-REFINEMENT

Toolbox in development for incremental synthesis of correct-by-construction switching protocols. 

## Functionality

 - Synthesis methods for augmented finite transition systems.
 - Abstraction tools based on hyper boxes.
 - Demonstrating examples.

## Authors

## Todo list

 - Implement remaining algorithms from manuscript, including control extraction
 - Create class that handles control strategy
 - (Candidate) losing set algorithms
 - Recursive candidate set computation
 - Class for semialgebraic partition/sets
 - Additional tests
    - Control strategies
    - System-level test
